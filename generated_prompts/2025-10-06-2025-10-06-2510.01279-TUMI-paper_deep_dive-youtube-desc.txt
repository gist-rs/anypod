Noob Vibe Paper: 2025-10-06-2510.01279-TUMI

Ever wondered how AI can think smarter by working together? Discover the revolutionary TUMIX framework that transforms how language models tackle complex problems!

• 🤝 TUMIX introduces a multi-agent system where multiple AI workers collaborate simultaneously, each using different tool strategies to solve the same problem and learn from each other's approaches

• 🚀 This innovative framework achieves up to 3.55% better accuracy on major reasoning benchmarks while maintaining the same inference cost, making it a game-changer for AI performance

• 🤖 The system intelligently adapts by using LLMs to automatically optimize agent designs, and can even stop early when confidence is high, cutting inference costs by half without sacrificing performance
