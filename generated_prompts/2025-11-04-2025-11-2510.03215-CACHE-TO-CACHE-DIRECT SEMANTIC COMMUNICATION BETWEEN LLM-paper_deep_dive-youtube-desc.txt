Noob Vibe Paper: 2025-11-2510.03215-CACHE-TO-CACHE-DIRECT SEMANTIC COMMUNICATION BETWEEN LLM

Did you know Large Language Models can now communicate directly through their internal memory instead of text? This revolutionary approach is about to change how AI systems work together.

🚀 Discover how Cache-to-Cache (C2C) enables LLMs to share semantic information directly through their internal representations
✨ Learn how this new paradigm achieves 8.5-10.5% higher accuracy while cutting latency in half compared to traditional text-based communication
🤖 Explore the neural network architecture that makes cross-model semantic transfer possible without losing rich contextual information
