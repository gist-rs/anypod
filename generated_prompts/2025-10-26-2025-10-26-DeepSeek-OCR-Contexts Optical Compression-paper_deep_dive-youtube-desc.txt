Noob Vibe Paper: 2025-10-26-DeepSeek-OCR-Contexts Optical Compression

Ever wonder how AI can compress massive documents into tiny data while keeping accuracy? DeepSeek-OCR shows us the future of long-context processing!

🚀 **Key Features:**  
- Introduces a novel optical 2D mapping technique to compress long text into manageable vision tokens  
- Achieves up to 97% OCR accuracy with a compression ratio of 10×, and still maintains 60% at 20×  
- Outperforms state-of-the-art models like GOT-OCR2.0 and MinerU2.0 using significantly fewer vision tokens  

✨ **Real-world Impact:**  
- Can process over 200,000 pages daily in production using a single A100-40G GPU  
- Demonstrates strong performance on OmniDocBench and Fox benchmarks  

🤖 **Tech Deep Dive:**  
- Powered by DeepEncoder and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M decoder for efficient compression and decoding  
- Supports multiple resolutions and is built for high-performance document understanding
