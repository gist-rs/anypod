🚀 **AI's next big leap in evaluation is here — and it’s measuring real-world job performance!**  

✨ OpenAI introduces **GDPVal**, a groundbreaking benchmark that tests AI models on 1,320 tasks across 44 real-world occupations, using tools like search, coding, and documentation — all designed to reflect the kind of work that matters economically.  
🤖 Early results show **Claude 4.1 Opus** leading the pack, with **GPT-5 “high”** trailing behind — and by 2026, OpenAI’s own **GPTNext** may match human expert performance.  
🧠 This new metric isn’t just about AI benchmarks — it’s a potential step toward **AGI**, redefining what we mean by “intelligent” in the context of real labor and economic value.
