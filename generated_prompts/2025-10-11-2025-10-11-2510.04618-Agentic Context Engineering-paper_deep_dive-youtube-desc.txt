Noob Vibe Paper: 2025-10-11-2510.04618-Agentic Context Engineering

Ready to revolutionize how AI models learn and adapt? Discover the future of language model optimization!

🚀 **ACE Framework Overview**: Learn about Agentic Context Engineering (ACE), a breakthrough approach that treats context as evolving playbooks, enabling self-improving AI systems through modular generation, reflection, and curation processes.

✨ **Key Innovations**: Understand how ACE tackles major challenges like brevity bias and context collapse, using structured incremental updates to preserve detailed knowledge while scaling with long-context models.

🤖 **Real-World Performance**: See how ACE outperforms existing baselines by 10.6% on agents and 8.6% on finance tasks, reduces adaptation latency, and even matches top production-level agents using smaller open-source models.
