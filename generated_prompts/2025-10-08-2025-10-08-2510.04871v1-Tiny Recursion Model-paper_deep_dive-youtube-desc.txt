Noob Vibe Paper: Tiny Recursion Model

Ever wondered if smaller AI models could outperform giant language models? Discover how tiny networks are revolutionizing problem-solving!

• 🚀 **Breakthrough Performance**: TRM achieves remarkable 45% accuracy on ARC-AGI1 with just 7 million parameters, outperforming massive LLMs while using less than 0.01% of their size

• ✨ **Simple Yet Powerful**: Unlike complex hierarchical models, TRM uses a straightforward 2-layer network that's easier to understand and implement while delivering superior generalization

• 🤖 **Future of Efficient AI**: This research shows that recursive reasoning with minimal networks can solve complex puzzles like Sudoku and mazes better than traditional large models, opening new possibilities for efficient AI
