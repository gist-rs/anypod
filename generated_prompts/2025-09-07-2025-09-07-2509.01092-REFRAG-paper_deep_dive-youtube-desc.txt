Want to supercharge your LLM performance? Discover how REFRAG revolutionizes RAG by cutting down context length and boosting speed up to 30x!

🚀 **How REFRAG works**: This innovative framework compresses unnecessary context chunks into smaller embeddings, making processing faster and more efficient.

✨ **Key benefits**: It dramatically increases context window size up to 16x while maintaining accuracy, perfect for long conversations and document summarization.

🤖 **Real-world impact**: By using reinforcement learning policies, REFRAG intelligently selects the most important tokens, significantly reducing latency and improving user experience.
