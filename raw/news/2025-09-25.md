Alibaba’s Qwen3 push: Max, VL, Coder and a $52B roadmap

Qwen3-Max, Qwen3-VL, and shipping velocity: Alibaba/Tongyi unveiled a sweep of models: flagship Qwen3-Max (now default in Anycoder) and open-sourced Qwen3-VL with a native 256K context (expandable to 1M), stronger OCR in 32 languages, precise event localization in 2h videos, GUI operation/coding, and leading risk detection. Releases hit Hugging Face, ModelScope, GitHub, and Alibaba Cloud’s Model Studio; community platforms onboarded quickly (e.g., Yupp added Qwen3 Max and Qwen3 VL 235B A22B Instruct/Thinking; LMArena added three Qwen3 models). Alibaba touted unmatched shipping velocity (~3.5 releases/month, many open weights) and a multi-year infrastructure roadmap discussed at Yunqi, with commentary noting a “$52B war chest” and major compute scale-up claims. See announcements and threads: @huybery, @huybery on Qwen3-VL, @Ali_TongyiLab (VL release), Anycoder defaults, Yupp adds Qwen models, LMArena adds Qwen3, shipping velocity, Yunqi recap, exec clips/roadmap.

Qwen3-Coder-Plus and API improvements: The coding line got targeted upgrades (terminal tasking, scaffold adaptation; API fixes), with early competitive signals in WebDev Arena and agent toolchains. Details: API update, WebDev Arena prompt.

Coding models and agents: GPT-5 Codex lands; Meta’s 32B CWM

GPT-5 Codex (agent-optimized) is live: OpenAI’s “Codex” variant is in the API and agent tools. Highlights: up to 400K context, “adaptive reasoning” with variable thinking that uses far fewer tokens on simple tasks and more on complex ones, and pricing around $1.25/$10 per million tokens. It’s integrated in Cline (with a “thinking slider”), and being benchmarked in webdev arenas and agent workflows. Links: API availability, Cline integration, Cline details, WebDev Arena. Field reports compare throughput vs Sonnet/GPT-5 on long-context and agent runtimes: example, long-context retrieval comparison.

Meta FAIR’s Code World Model (CWM) 32B (research): Meta released an open-weight 32B dense model under a research license that frames code generation as planning with a world model of code execution. Reported pass@1: 65.8% SWE-bench Verified, 68.6% LiveCodeBench, 96.6% Math-500, 76.0% AIME 2024. Technical report, weights, and code are public, with a safety preparedness report from SEAL/AI Security. Links: @AIatMeta, @ylecun, metrics summary, safety prep.

Ecosystem updates: GitHub Copilot’s new embedding model and training writeup (for faster, more accurate code search) blog link; Jules agent now acts on PR feedback link; Claude Sonnet 4 and Opus 4.1 are now in Microsoft 365 Copilot Anthropic.

Systems and infra: vLLM DCP, multimodal data plumbing, and platform moves

vLLM 0.10.2 adds Decode Context Parallel (DCP): Contributed by Kimi/Moonshot, DCP shards KV cache across GPUs to cut duplication, enabling up to 8× larger KV and 2–3× throughput on single-node H200—especially helpful for KV-heavy workloads (RL, offline data generation). Quickstart: vllm serve deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus -tp 8 -dcp 8. Links: @vllm_project, day-0 guides.

Multimodal infra from Perceptron: The team shared the design behind TensorStream—a tensor-like abstraction for interleaved multimodal data powering their training/inference code—and released technical details for Isaac 0.1, a small VLM emphasizing a simple training recipe and robust grounding. Good discussion on “complexity budgets” and native multimodal abstractions: design post, Isaac report, commentary, abstractions +1.

MCP builders and compliance: Figma’s MCP server lands in VS Code (and is usable in OpenHands) for “design-to-code” flows VS Code, OpenHands; Weaviate gets ISO 27001 link; AMD expands partnership with Cohere (models on AMD Instinct, sovereign AI posture) AMD; Modular raises $250M to push its unified AI infra platform Modular.

Video and multimodal generation: Alibaba Wan2.5, Runway A2D, NVIDIA Lyra, Kling 2.5

Alibaba Wan2.5-Preview (native multimodality): New architecture aligns text, image, video, and audio natively with joint multimodal training and RLHF; supports controllable inputs (text/img/audio), synchronized multi-speaker A/V, 1080p 10s cinematic video, and stronger image gen/editing (typography, charts, pixel-level edits). Announcement.

Runway A2D: autoregressive-to-diffusion VLM: Adapts existing AR VLMs for parallel diffusion decoding to unlock speed–quality trade-offs without training from scratch; dev preview from internship work shows practical path to diffusion LMs for vision-language. @runwayml, author thread.

NVIDIA Lyra (3D/4D scene reconstruction): Feed-forward 3D and 4D scene generation from a single image/video via video diffusion self-distillation; weights on HF. Overview, model.

Kling 2.5 Turbo: Internal blind tests show significant wins over Seedance/Veo variants across text-to-video and image-to-video; community reels and contests rolling out. Results, contest.

Reasoning, RL, and evaluation science

RLPT (RL on Pre-Training Data): Trains with self-supervised rewards via next-segment reasoning (ASR+MSR) directly on pretraining corpora—no human labels. On Qwen3‑4B, reported gains: +3.0 MMLU, +8.1 GPQA‑Diamond, +6.6 AIME24, +5.3 AIME25. Paper: tweet, arXiv.

APRIL (Active Partial Rollouts in RL): Cuts rollout long-tail inefficiency; up to 44% throughput and 8% final-accuracy improvements across GRPO/DAPO/GSPO. tweet, code/paper.

“Soft Tokens, Hard Truths”: First scalable RL for continuous CoT; soft-token training matches discrete pass@1 and outperforms at pass@32 by boosting diversity; best practice: train soft, infer hard. tweet, arXiv.

Effective reasoning ≠ longer CoTs: Across 10 LRMs, longer chains and review can correlate with lower accuracy. New metric “Failed-Step Fraction” predicts correctness; FSF-based reranking lifts pass@1 up to +10%. tweet, arXiv.

Medical multimodal brittleness: Stress tests show frontier models often guess correctly without images, flip under trivial prompt changes, and fabricate convincing but flawed reasoning—leaderboards mask fragility. tweet, arXiv.
