Karl Marx once wrote that “the human essence is the ensemble of social relations” (Marx, 1845), suggesting
that individuals are not isolated entities, but are fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other
entities — within which contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely human-human interactions:
human-machine interactions are included as well. Then a central question emerges: How can machines
better understand our situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
“developed” the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as a recent innovation of the
agent era, in fact, we argue that related practices can be traced back to over 20 years ago. Since the early
1990s, it has evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by its intelligence level of machines:
from early human-computer interaction (HCI) frameworks built around primitive computers, to today’s
human-agent interaction (HAI) paradigms driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human-level or
even superhuman intelligence in the future. In this paper, we discuss the context of context engineering,
provide a systematic definition, outline our perspective on its historical and conceptual landscape, and
examine key design considerations for its practice. By addressing these questions, we aim to offer a
conceptual foundation for context engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper serves as a
stepping stone for a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

Conclusion
In this paper, we explore the context of context engineering, arguing that it is not a sudden invention of the LLM
era but a long-evolving discipline shaped by the progressive intelligence of machines. By tracing its historical
phases and by outlining design considerations that govern its practice, we highlight how the core challenge lies
in bridging human intent and machine understanding under varying levels of entropy. Our proposed trajectory
suggests a gradual human disengagement from explicit context management, as increasingly intelligent machines
take on greater responsibility for interpreting, reasoning, and even constructing context. Looking ahead, as machine
understanding approaches and potentially surpasses human cognition, culminating in a possible “god’s eye view”
of our intentions, AI systems may not only comprehend us, but also illuminate and expand our understanding of
ourselves.
