THINK RIGHT: LEARNING TO MITIGATE UNDER-OVER
THINKING VIA ADAPTIVE, ATTENTIVE COMPRESSION

ABSTRACT
Recent thinking models are capable of solving complex reasoning tasks by scaling test-time compute across various domains, but this scaling must be allocated
in line with task difficulty. On one hand, short reasoning (underthinking) leads
to errors on harder problems that require extended reasoning steps; but, excessively long reasoning (overthinking) can be token-inefficient, generating unnecessary steps even after reaching a correct intermediate solution. We refer to this
as under-adaptivity, where the model fails to modulate its response length appropriately given problems of varying difficulty. To address under-adaptivity and
strike a balance between under- and overthinking, we propose TRAAC (Think Right
with Adaptive, Attentive Compression), an online post-training RL method that
leverages the model’s self-attention over a long reasoning trajectory to identify
important steps and prune redundant ones. TRAAC also estimates difficulty and incorporates it into training rewards, thereby learning to allocate reasoning budget
commensurate with example difficulty. Our approach improves accuracy, reduces
reasoning steps, and enables adaptive thinking compared to base models and other
RL baselines. Across a variety of tasks (AIME, AMC, GPQA-D, BBEH), TRAAC
(Qwen3-4B) achieves an average absolute accuracy gain of 8.4% with a relative
reduction in reasoning length of 36.8% compared to the base model, and a 7.9%
accuracy gain paired with a 29.4% length drop compared to the best RL baseline.
TRAAC also shows strong generalization: although our models are trained on math
datasets, they show accuracy and efficiency gains on out-of-distribution non-math
datasets like GPQA-D, BBEH, and OptimalThinkingBench. Our analysis further
verifies that TRAAC provides fine-grained adjustments to thinking budget based on
difficulty and that a combination of task-difficulty calibration and attention-based
compression yields gains across diverse tasks.1
